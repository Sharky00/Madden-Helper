## NFL Tie-Breaking Procedures

The following procedures are used to break standing ties for both postseason playoff seeding and regular-season scheduling. **Note:** Tie games are counted as one-half win and one-half loss.

---

### Seeding Overview

Each conference sends seven teams to the postseason, seeded in this order:

1. Division champion with best record
2. Division champion with second-best record
3. Division champion with third-best record
4. Division champion with fourth-best record
5. Wild-card team with best record
6. Wild-card team with second-best record
7. Wild-card team with third-best record ([NFL Support][1], [NFL Football Operations][2], [Fox Sports][3])

---

### Division Tie-Breaker (Within a Division)

When two or more teams in the same division are tied in win-loss-tie percentage:

#### Two Clubs

1. Head‑to‑head record
2. Best win‑loss‑tie percentage in division games
3. Best win‑loss‑tie percentage in common games
4. Best win‑loss‑tie percentage in conference games
5. Strength of victory
6. Strength of schedule
7. Combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed
8. Combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed ([NFL Football Operations][2], [ESPN.com][4])

#### Notes on Three (or More) Clubs

* The same steps apply.
* If, during the process, some teams are eliminated but two remain tied, the tiebreaker **reverts back to step one** of the two‑club format. ([ESPN.com][4], [PFSN][5])

---

### Wild-Card Tie-Breaker (Between Non-Division Tied Teams)

#### If tied clubs are from **the same division**

Apply the **division tie‑breaker** rules above.

#### If tied clubs are from **different divisions**:

**Two Clubs**

1. Head‑to‑head record (if applicable)
2. Best win‑loss‑tie percentage in conference games
3. Best win‑loss‑tie percentage in common games (minimum of four games)
4. Strength of victory
5. Strength of schedule
6. Combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed
7. Combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed
8. Net points in conference games
9. Net points in all games
10. Net touchdowns in all games
11. Coin toss ([ESPN.com][4])

**Three (or More) Clubs**

1. First, apply division tie-breakers within each division to eliminate all but the highest-ranked club from each division.
2. Then apply:

   * Head-to-head sweep (if one team has beaten all the others or lost to all)
   * Conference win‑loss percentage
   * Win‑loss percentage in common games (minimum four games)
   * Strength of victory
   * Strength of schedule
   * Combined points scored/allowed rankings (conference and leaguewide)
   * Net points (in conference and leaguewide)
   * Net touchdowns
   * Coin toss ([ESPN.com][4], [Fox Sports][6])

And again—if at any point only two clubs remain tied, revert to the two‑club format starting from step one. ([ESPN.com][4])

### Additional Clarifications

* **Only one team advances** at each tiebreaking step; others restart at step one. ([The Sun][7])
* When comparing records (e.g., division, conference, common games), the **best win‑loss‑tie percentage** is used—this accounts for potentially unequal numbers of games played. ([The Sun][7])
* For **home-field priority**:

  * Division winners: apply **wild-card tie-breakers**
  * Wild-card teams: if from the same division, apply **division tie-breakers**; if not, apply **wild-card tie-breakers** ([The Sun][7], [ESPN.com][4])
