## Part 2: Tiebreaker Scenarios

### Division Rivalry Breakdown
For each rival in the division, analyze tiebreaker chances:
For the head to head record please understand that you only play twice a season so if a team is 2-0 they win the tiebreaker
1-1 is a split and it means they need to go to the next rule
and 0-1 means its undecided but its worth looking at the other rules
- **vs [Division Rival #1]**  
  - Head-to-head record: [e.g., 1–1 split]  
  - Division record comparison: [e.g., Team A 3–2 vs Team B 4–1]

## Example

Here’s the Seahawks’ season, told straight from your processed schedule file — and what it means for seeding/tiebreaks.

How their year has played out (from your data)

Hot start, statement wins. They open by beating the 49ers on the road (26–21), then thump the Falcons at home (31–13). 
 

Road-tested. Wins at the Saints (37–31) and at the Chargers (24–10) show they travel well. 
 

Owning the division. Home over Arizona (20–14), road over Arizona again (17–16), a squeaker at the Rams (24–21), then a 31–7 home blowout of the 49ers. That’s a division sweep in the results we can see. 
 
 
 

Mid-season grind, still clutch. Close wins vs the Giants (35–21), Raiders (27–24), Panthers (20–17). 
 
 

Signature upset. They walk into Kansas City and win 38–20. 

Another solid travel win. At Tampa Bay: 31–17. 

From those logged results (Weeks 1, 2, 4–9, 11–15), Seattle wins every time shown, with a combined +129 point differential across those games. A Week 17 home date vs the Rams is listed as scheduled/pending in your file. 

What that means for playoff positioning

If the Seahawks finish tied with another NFC West team, the NFL applies division tiebreakers in this order:

Head-to-head, 2) Division record, 3) Common games, 4) Conference record, 5) Strength of victory, then strength of schedule, etc.

Given your data shows Seattle beating San Francisco twice (road in Week 1 and home in Week 14) and wins over Arizona (home and away) and the Rams (away), they’d currently control the key tiebreaks—head-to-head and division record—over their rivals if those results hold.
